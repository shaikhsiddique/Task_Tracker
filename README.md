## Authentication

### Login & Signup
Users can securely register and log in using their email and password. Authentication is managed via JWT tokens.

## Task Management

### Create Task
Users can create tasks by providing details such as title, description, due date, and priority.

### Search Task
A search feature allows users to quickly find tasks using keywords, status, or deadlines.

### Display Personal Tasks
All tasks are displayed on a personal dashboard, enabling users to manage their to-do lists efficiently.

### Assign Task
Tasks can be delegated to other workspace members, allowing for better workload distribution.

### Task Completion & Deadline Notifications
- **Task Completion:**  
  Mark tasks as complete by clicking the task circle. A filled circle indicates completion, while an outlined circle shows a pending task.
- **Deadline Notifications:**  
  Receive email reminders and in-app notifications about approaching deadlines.

## Workspace Management

### Creating a Workspace
When a user creates a workspace, they automatically become its admin, gaining full control over workspace settings.

### Editing & Joining Workspaces
- **Editing:**  
  Admins can edit workspace details.
- **Joining:**  
  To join a workspace, the admin sends an invitation or the user sends a join request. Notifications are sent to the appropriate party for acceptance.

### Adding Members
Admins can add members by sending requests. The targeted user receives an in-app notification to accept the invite. Similarly, when a user requests to join a workspace, a notification is sent to the admin for approval.

## Collaboration

Within a workspace, users can:
- **Chat:**  
  Engage in real-time text-based communication.
- **Assign Tasks:**  
  Delegate tasks to colleagues directly.
- **Video Calls:**  
  Initiate video calls for live collaboration and meetings.

## AI Integration

The workspace chat includes AI integration. If a message is prefixed with `@ai`, it is directed to the AI, which responds with `@ai` and the sender‚Äôs username.

## Account Overview & Productivity

The account page displays:
- Personal details (e.g., username, email, profile image)
- A summary of tasks: total tasks, assigned tasks, completed tasks, and tasks with met deadlines
- A productivity score (starting at 1000) that adjusts based on task performance
